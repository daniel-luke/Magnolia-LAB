# Magnolia LAB Environment

This repository initializes a fully working Magnolia Instance (Author and Public) and offers easy commands to generate light modules from the Magnolia CLI.

Recommended is to use **IntelliJ Idea** because the run configuratons are already optimized.

## Installation
**IMPORTANT: Clone the repository in your {USER}/Documents/LAB folder.**
**Only MacOS is supported**
1. Open up the repository in **IntelliJ Idea**.
2. Go to `Run Configurations` and run the `setup` script.
3. Then, also in the `Run Configurations`, run the `Create Light Module` script to get up and running.
4. Use the `Start Magnolia` command to boot up your instance.

Happy Coding! :)
